About AirBnb

Airbnb is a community-based online service for people to advertise, discover and book accommodations and lodging facilities.

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand travel possibilities, with more flexibility and discover new ways of experiencing the world.
Today, Airbnb has become a unique service and is recognized all over the world. Analyzing data from millions of listings provided through Airbnb is an important factor for the company.

These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analyzed and used for security, business decisions,
understanding the behavior and performance of customers and providers (hosts) on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementing innovative additional services, and much more.

This dataset has around 32,000 observations in it with 75 columns and it is a mix between categorical and numeric values.
The exploratory analysis of Airbnb dataset 2023 in Rio de Janeiro provided valuable insights into the dynamics of pricing and preferences in different neighbourhoods.

Through the Jupyter Notebook I have tried to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with WordClouds and Maps.
